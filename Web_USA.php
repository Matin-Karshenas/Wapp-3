                The United States of America (USA) is a federal republic located primarily in North America, composed of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), and several territories. It is one of the world's largest and most diverse countries, both geographically and culturally. The USA has a strong influence on global politics, economics, culture, and technology. Founded in 1776, it became a world power by the 20th century and remains a leading nation in military and economic terms. Its political system is based on democratic principles, with a president serving as head of state and government, alongside a Congress and judiciary.
